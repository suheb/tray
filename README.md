# Tray Test

## Prerequisites
Youâ€™ll need to have Node 8.16.0 or Node 10.16.0 or later version on your local development machine.

## Step to Run:

In the project directory, you can run:

1. `yarn install` to install the dependencies

2. `yarn start` to run the app in the development mode.

3. `yarn test` to launch the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

4. `yarn build` to build the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!
